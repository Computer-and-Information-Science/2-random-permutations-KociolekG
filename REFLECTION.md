# Assignment 2 Reflection - Gage Kociolek

## Approach to the Problem

I mostly had the intention to try to go by what's summarized and instructed from the provided pdf. It's why I put those comments for each of the algorithms on the suggested tips for a reminder.

## Techniques Used

I don't believe I did anything ground-breaking, I like using more simple approaches usually.
Like I said, I just try to do whats suggested mostly. Generally I utilized integrated randomized assign values, used enforcement to try prevent repeats, and included the algorithm library to properly use swap.
I used --> for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) as a starter template.

## Challenges Encountered

My biggest troubles are usually figuring out how to start solving a problem. I don't remember what I did
for algorithm 1 but I didn't even get an output at first. I'd have to look into how to check version history again, but I basically just tore down what I had and started from scratch. I think permutation 3
was my last struggle as I had to add another library to make it work as I wanted.

## Conclusions

To my understanding, the smaller the n value, the better. I believe I recall from class that certain
situations call for different algorithms and thus, complexity time evaluations. From what I learned, there really isn't a bad sorting algorithm besides Bogo. Difficulty and time efficiency are factors for
consideration.
